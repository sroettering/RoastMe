			<h3>14. Notice and Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright or Other Intellectual Property Infringements</h3>
			<p>
				itsroast.me respects the intellectual property of others and takes the protection of copyrights and all other intellectual property very seriously, and we ask our users to do the same.  Infringing activity will not be tolerated on or through the Services.
			</p>
			<p>
				itsroast.me’s intellectual property policy is to (a) remove material that itsroast.me believes in good faith, upon notice from an intellectual property owner or their agent, is infringing the intellectual property of a third party by being made available through the Services, and (b) remove any Subscriber Content posted to the Services by “repeat infringers.”  itsroast.me considers a “repeat infringer” to be any user that has uploaded Subscriber Content to the Services and for whom itsroast.me has received more than two takedown notices compliant with the provisions of 17 U.S.C. § 512(c) with respect to such Subscriber Content.  itsroast.me has discretion, however, to terminate the account of any user after receipt of a single notification of claimed infringement or upon itsroast.me’s own determination.
